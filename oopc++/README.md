#### Object Oriented (and Generic) Programming in C++

An elective course, prerequsites are 4 programming courses in C and C++.
Most of the lab notes are in Croatian, but I hope to add short summaries in English soon.

Development enviroment is linux with C++14 standard compiled with either clang or g++.
I used Qt Creator as IDE with clang-format.
CMake is used to coordinate builds.
Testing is performed with Google Test.
