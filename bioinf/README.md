Bioinformatics course at Uni. of Zagreb in spring semester of 2018.
Sorted by lecture number, solutions in python3 (some in python2, hope to change that soon) or C++14.
Also some solved tasks of past years.
There are more tasks I hope to add them some time.

Topics include:
    1) Dynamic programming
    2) Hidden Markov Models
    3) Sequence alignment
    4) Clustering (K-means) 
    5) Other topics soon to be discovered
